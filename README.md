# Todoist.nvim
Plugin for managing Todoist through Neovim using a more vim-like syntax

The attempt with this is that we are able to get something similar to oil.nvim but for the task lists in our lives.

In addition, my goal is to use new neovim features to enable a better experience using more shared tooling including:
- Treesitter support for the files
- an actual filetype that can be used in source control and can be updated directly so that this application becoming an offline-first application naturally falls out of the design

# Requirements
We are using bleeding-edge Neovim features so for now the requirements are:
- Neovim Nightly
- Treesitter
- plenary 
- curl
